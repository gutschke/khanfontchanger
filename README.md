# khanfontchanger
Khan Academy has a rather unfortunate choice for the font used
when adding annotations to a math problem. Many glyphs are
indistinguishable or ambiguous. That makes text areas somewhat
unusable for taking notes that relate to mathematical expressions.

This extension overrides the site's default settings and always
picks a "Roboto" font instead. Plain, readable, and has most of
the glyphs anybody would care about.
